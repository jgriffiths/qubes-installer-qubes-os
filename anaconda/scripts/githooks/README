git hooks for anaconda development

commit-msg
    For rhel*-branch branches, ensures that commits reference an
    approved RHEL bug for the appropriate release in the correct
    format.

    To use, copy this script to your .git/hooks directory and make
    sure you have the python-bugzilla package installed.  You might
    also want to create a ~/.rhbzauth file containing two shell
    variables:  RHBZ_USER and RHBZ_PASSWORD to allow automatic login
    when commiting patches.

pre-commit
    Run the runpylint.sh test on the files changed in the commit.

    To use, copy this script to your .git/hooks directory and
    edit the OTHER_MODULES_PATH to point to where you normally have
    pykickstart and blivet checked out. Note that if the current
    working versions of these differ too much the pylint checks may
    fail.

    Set the NOPYLINT= environmental variable while committing to skip
    running pylint. eg.
    NOPYLINT= git commit -a -m "I didn't break it"
